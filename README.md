**Latest per-state results and three-month projections provided in the [US Figure Browser](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/douglasmason/covid_model/blob/master/plot_browser_moving_window_statsmodels_only_US_states/index.html) and [International Figure Browser](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/douglasmason/covid_model/blob/master/plot_browser_moving_window_statsmodels_only_countries/index.html)**

**Tabulated projections can be found within the [US CSV](https://covid-figures.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020_05_21_date_smoothed_moving_window_21_days_US_states_region_statsmodels/simplified_state_prediction.csv) and [International CSV](https://covid-figures.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020_05_21_date_smoothed_moving_window_21_days_countries_region_statsmodels/simplified_state_prediction.csv)**

~~*We are looking for more compute resources so we can provide results for each state on a daily basis at high fidelity, requiring 10x more samples. If you would like to help please contact the contributors.*~~

*Thank You to Digital Ocean and Black Sails Consulting for access to compute resources for this project.*

*We've  implemented a simple photo browser to help readers deep-dive. If you would like to design an interface for people to beautifully and easily find their nation, province, or county, and the metrics that matter to them, please contact the contributors.*

*To run the code that generates the paper figures, clone repo and execute `python paper_figures_convolution.py; python paper_figures_moving_window.py`*

*To run the code that generates the daily updates, clone repo and execute `python daily_cron_job.py`.

We model universal curves of reported COVID-19 daily reported infections and related deaths using a linear regression with standard errors and a weekly profile in the log space (making it an exponential regression in linear space). Using currently available data from [N. Y. Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) and [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), we fit our model parameters to the most recent three weeks and provide projections for the next three months.

**Figure 1a:** Three-week moving-window model prediction curves for three months and COVID-19 Daily Reported Cases and Related Deaths in the U.S. This is what we predict would happen if the trend from the last three weeks continued for the next three months.

**Figure 1b:** Three-week moving-window model prediction curves for three months and COVID-19 Comulative Reported Cases and Related Deaths in the U.S. This is what we predict would happen if the trend from the last three weeks continued for the next three months.
